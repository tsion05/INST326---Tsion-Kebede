Week 1
This week I used AI while working on the exercises to explain certain python
concepts and to provide coding examples for python concepts including f-strings,
for example. I did not use AI to complete any of the exercises. I did not use AI
for debugging. Here are my AI chat links. https://chatgpt.com/share/68bdbf24-0104-

My project team also used AI to help organize our project ideas and translate them
into project requirements that we used to draft the project charter. [link to chat]
I tried out Gemini AI this week and did not have a good experience. [Add whatever
details you want that are useful to you]
I ran a comparison test using the same documents and prompts between Claude,
ChatGPT, and Gemini. They gave me pretty different results even using the same
prompts. I used a separate instance of Claude to help design, analyze, and fine
tune the test. In the end, we optimized the prompt and documents for ChatGPT and
were able to dial-in results that were close to our expected targets. I learned a
lot about why different AI models return such different results on the same
prompts. Turns out that its about biases in their analytic models, not unlike
people.
