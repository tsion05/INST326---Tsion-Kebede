Section 0202

Week 1 
This week, I didn't use AI much. I try to limit the amount of AI I use because of its environmental harm. 
The only time I used AI was to try and find a hotel that has an 18+ check in near me.

I also used Grammarly to fix any grammar and spelling mistakes on assignments I had for another class.  

Week 2
This week, I didn't use AI much. Even though I try to limit the amount of AI I use, I've been 
desperate to try and find internships around the DMV area for the summer. I asked ChatGPT to try and find
some for me. However, some of them weren't what I was looking for.

I also used ChatGPT to help me understand some of the coding problems in the Week 02 Exercises however, 
I don't have a link to it because I wasn't logged in when using ChatGPT. 

Week 3
This week, I used AI for personal reasons. I and for the Week 3 Exercises. My face has been breaking out recently so 
I asked ChatGPT to develop a skincare routine for me to use. I'm going to start using this routine on monday and see 
if my acne starts to clear up.

I also recently bought laundry sanitizer and was a little confused on how to use it. I asked ChatGPT for help 
because I felt like Google wasn't giving me the answer I was looking for. But, ChatGPT definitely helped.

The Week 3 Exercises were kind of hard for me and I did ask ChatGPT to help me understand what the questions were asking and
to explain some code. I wasn't logged in when this happened so I don't have a link. 

Week 4
This week, I asked AI to try and develop a workout routine for me. I turn 20 in less then a month 
and I want to start focusing on my health. I liked that ChatGPT was able to give me a whole routine 
to follow because I'm new to the gym and I don't know what to do.

Week 5
This week I asked ChatGPT to help me understand Project 1 for this class. I didn't understand how 
to use Github the way the assignment wanted us to. So, one of my groupmates told me to put her 
instructions into ChatGPT and it would walk me though it. And it did!
