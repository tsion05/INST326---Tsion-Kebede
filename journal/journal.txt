Section 0202

Week 1 
This week, I didn't use AI much. I try to limit the amount of AI I use because of its environmental harm. 
The only time I used AI was to try and find a hotel that has an 18+ check in near me.

I also used Grammarly to fix any grammar and spelling mistakes on assignments I had for another class.  

Week 2
This week, I didn't use AI much. Even though I try to limit the amount of AI I use, I've been 
desperate to try and find internships around the DMV area for the summer. I asked ChatGPT to try and find
some for me. However, some of them weren't what I was looking for.

I also used ChatGPT to help me understand some of the coding problems in the Week 02 Exercises however, 
I don't have a link to it because I wasn't logged in when using ChatGPT. 

Week 3
This week, I used AI for personal reasons. I didn't use it for assignments. My face has been breaking out recently so 
I asked ChatGPT to develop a skincare routine for me to use. I'm going to start using this routine on monday and see 
if my acne starts to clear up.

I also recently bought laundry sanitizer and was a little confused on how to use it. I asked ChatGPT for help 
because I felt like Google wasn't giving me the answer I was looking for. But, ChatGPT definitely helped.
